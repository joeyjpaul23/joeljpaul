            <h3 class="project-title">F1 Winner Prediction Algorithm</h3>
            <p class="project-description">This project began as an experiment to merge my love for Formula 1 with my curiosity about machine learning. 
                After a wild start to the 2024 - 25 season, I wanted to know whether I could use pattern recognition to predict a winner. Using features like driver's track history and weekend stats, 
                I trained Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression models that achieved a 93% accuracy in predicting race winners. 
                This project was a fun and interesting experiment that taught me about the vast capabilities of machine learning and AI.

                Currently working on a frontend so users can input data and receive predictions. Check back soon!

            <p class="project-description">This project is a simple personal website built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
                I'm using it to showcase my projects and my resume, as well as to work with frontend development and design.
